Licensing
=========

This is a project started in 2010 to play around with Scala and Vaadin. It's purpose is to act as a software licensing system.

I revived the project in mid 2014 and plan to find some time in between regular work, android development and game development to revitalize the project and put it into production.

Roadmap
-------

Get main UI elements / pages working
Add back button support
Internationalization

Investigate reports (maybe integrate High Charts)
Would be cool to have a map with the locations of the installations (using something like http://maplacejs.com/)
