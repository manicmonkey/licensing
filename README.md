Licensing
=========

This is a project started in 2010 to play around with Scala and Vaadin. It's purpose is to act as a software licensing system.

I revived the project in mid 2014 and plan to find some time in between regular work, android development and game development to revitalize the project and put it into production.

Mockups can be seen using pencil.
